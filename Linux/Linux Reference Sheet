#Linux Commands File (Ubuntu, though a lot of these commands can also be used for Debian)

#Basic Commands

# cd : This command is used to change directories, it needs the relative path of the directory you are trying to access, though you
# can also place the absolute path to change into any directory as long as you know the absolute path to the directory.
# Example: cd /Documents/ScienceFair 
# The example shown would access the directory called "ScienceFair" assuming you are in a directory that contains the "sub directory" 
# called "Science Fair", this is a relative path to your working directory. A absolute path would be from your root directory(~ in linux).
#Example: cd ~/Documents/ScienceFair
# In order to change back to home directory all you need to do is run (cd) without any modifiers 

# ls : This commannd lists the contents of the current directory if no modifiers or relative paths are added. But this command can
# have modifiers such as (-a, or -l), which is a short for "all"(-l simply shows this in a column), this modifer will lists more information 
# of the files contained, very useful for forensic work. This command can also have relative and absolute paths in order to list files
# that are not in your working directory (btw a working directory is simply the directory you are in).
#Example: ls -a /Downloads/LinuxOS/Debian
#This example uses the -a(all) modifier and the relative path of the working directory, but it is useful to know that just 
#using ls in a working directory does print just the contents in it with minimal information and absolute paths can also be used.

#nano : This command accesses the nano text editor( allows you to access and modifi text files)
Example: nano hello.txt
# opens the hello.txt 

# man : opens the manual for a given command
Example: man cd
# this opens the manual page for the command cd

# pwd : (print working directory) This command prints the directory you are in ( usefull if you get lost)
#Example: pwd 
# Prints the working directory

# touch : Creates a completely empty file (can be used to also create files with extensions such as .txt)
Example: touch test6
#This example creates an empty file
Example: touch test6.txt
#Creates a txt file named test6.txt
#( if you use the touch command on an existing file you can change the creation/modification time to the time you used touch on the file)
#( also useful for scripting)

# nano : 


# Complex Commands

# chmod : this command changes the user's,group and worldpermissions of a file or directory.
#Example: chmod 0755 /Commandtest
# This command changes gives the owner of the file read,write, and execute capabilities( the Second digit), gives
# read and write to the group (the Third digit) and read only for the rest("world", only read capabilities).
# this example uses numeric permissions
