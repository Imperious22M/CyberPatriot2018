#Basic Commands

# cd : This command is used to change directories, it needs the relative path of the directory you are trying to access, thou you
# can also place the absolute path to change into any directory as long as you know the absolute path to the directory.
# Example: cd /Documents/ScienceFair 
# The example shown would access the directory called "ScienceFair" assuming you are in a directory that contains the "sub directory" 
# called "Science Fair", this is a relative path to your working directory. A absolute path would be from your root directory(~ in linux).
#Example: cd ~/Documents/ScienceFair
# In order to change back to home directory all you need to do is run (cd) without any modifiers 

# ls : This commannd lists the contents of the current directory if no modifiers or relative paths are added.
