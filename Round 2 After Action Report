Pros:
Learning to add people to a group
Cisco reference sheet was good
Cisco didnt ask for too much just ospf,vlans, trunking
Reference sheet helped - Linux
using an online hash program to get a hash
forensic questions were easy
Continue to check for little curveballs e.g. ctrl-alt-del




Cons:
Windows:
Once we went through the github we were out of ideas
windows 10 wouldnt update
Windows 8 adobe wouldnt update
Wndows 8 windows defender wouldnt update/ run 

Linux:
Locked out of using a password
Randomly generating passwords
For next time. Give all the users the same secure passsword CyberPatriot782!?

Cisco:
Nothing on interVLAN routing
A lot on OSPF RIP B___ for the quiz
Don't click on links in the README
